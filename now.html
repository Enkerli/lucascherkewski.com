	It’s summer, and I’m eating sweet peas and walking and reading.

<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
	Professionally, I’m wrapping up some projects and keeping a low profile. Come September,
	I want to move from independent consulting to a stint of part-time work.
	I’ve always worked independently, but part of me wants to be part of a team, to
	experience a new set of challenges and rewards. Whether that’ll happen and what that’d look
	like, I’m not sure, but I want to explore beyond my status quo.
</p>

<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
	Moving between Ottawa and Waterloo has been enlightening. In each, I’ve experienced great
	lethargy and great activity. How to diminish the former and extend the latter
	is often on my mind. But perhaps the lethargy supports the activity; with time, maybe I’ll know.
</p>

<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
	I’m looking forward to settling back into Ottawa with some permanence come September. That act
	of settling will tax my freedom, but no matter. For now, I have my sweet peas and my
	walking shoes and my books.
