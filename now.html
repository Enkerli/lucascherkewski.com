<p class="f3 measure lh-copy">
	I’m sharing my time between Ottawa and Waterloo.
</p>

<p class="f3 measure lh-copy">
	I’m spending the next few months working on select client projects. I’m also dedicating time to community civic tech
	projects and some long-neglected personal projects. Here are some examples:
</p>

<ul class="measure mt3 mb3 f3 fw3 lh-copy pl5">
	<li class="mt2">
		<a class="dim light-purple" href="https://github.com/GoC-Spending/GoC-Spending">Collecting and summarizing federal government spending</a>,
		to help citizens understand what and to who governments contract (an <a class="dim light-purple" href="http://yowcivictech.ca/">Ottawa Civic Tech</a> project)
	</li>
	<li class="mt2">
		Returning to my website with new writing
	</li>
	<li class="mt2">
		Writing talks about research and working methods, and finding places to deliver them
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="f3 measure lh-copy">
	To be frank, I’m mostly decompressing after constant busyness during the last few months of school. With my newly
	returned spare time, I’m exploring Ottawa and diving into non-academic interests. This means lots of reading, which
	you can track on <a class="dim light-purple" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27072166-lucas-cherkewski">Goodreads</a>.
</p>

<p class="f3 measure lh-copy">
	I’m also intentionally reconnecting with friends and overcoming my tendency toward social isolation. If you want to
	meet up, to reconnect or to get to know each other better,
	<a class="dim light-purple" href="mailto:lucas@lucascherkewski.com">I’m happy to chat</a>!
