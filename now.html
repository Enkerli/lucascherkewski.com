	It’s fall, and I’m keeping busy.
</p>

<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
	Professionally, I’m gearing up to find a co-op job for next summer. I’d like to combine
	my interest in policy with my experience as a web developer. How or if that will manifest, I’m
	still sorting out.

	Academically, I’m starting a small research project into how Ontario teachers shared ideas
	and thoughts during the advent of standardized(ish) educational computing during the 1980s.
	It’s really cool!
</p>

<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
	I’m also establishing a writing practice. Each week, I’ve been publishing <a class="dim light-purple" href="/hit-and-miss/">an email newsletter</a>,
	both to keep up with friends and to encourage a regular writing routine.

	I’m facing a just-less-than-two-month stint here in Ottawa, which excites me. I love this city
	and I think I love it most during this season. I’m aiming for steadiness and consistency: reinforcing
	routines, seeking stability. But I’m also trying to open myself up a bit socially. It’s coming… slowly.
	Mostly, I’m just noticing the months fly by.
