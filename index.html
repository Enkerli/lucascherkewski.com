	Welcome to my home on the internet!
</p>

<p class="measure-narrow f2 lh-copy fw3">
	I’m a designer in Ottawa, just doing my best. I’m interested in how design can help humanity, and I work here to
	determine my part in that process, while also exploring my various interests.
</p>

<p class="measure f3 lh-copy">
	This site is a holding grounds for things related to me: <a class="dim purple" href="/office/">those I’ve worked
	on</a>, and <a class="dim purple" href="/study/">those I’ve cultivated</a>.
	This site has <a class="dim purple" href="/study/manifesto/">a manifesto</a> to suggest what a personal site could be.
</p>

<p class="measure f5 lh-copy">
	P.S. I really do view this as my home on the internet. Feel free to come in and make yourself comfortable; you’re
	invited to explore these public workings of my brain and get to know me a bit better.
</p>

<p class="measure f5 lh-copy">
	If anything here strikes you, don’t hesitate to <a class="dim light-purple" href="mailto:lucas@lucascherkewski.com">email me</a>.
	I look forward to hearing from you!
