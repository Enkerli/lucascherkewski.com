I’m excited to see the government try to reach new businesses in their contracting, especially when it
involves open source software development. But these efforts could be better suited to the kinds of
businesses which work with open source software.

Consider a recent [contract pre-announcement](https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-17-00786791){:link}.
Sorry—a "letter of interest" for a "tender," through the "procurement" process. This naming confusion is the first hurdle: government
contracting is laden with jargon. Potential contractors shouldn’t have to wade through a government
glossary to understand the proposal process. Plain language alternatives abound; government should use them.

Aside from an overabundance of passive voice constructions
