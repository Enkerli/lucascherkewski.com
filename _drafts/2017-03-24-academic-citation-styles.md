I prefer Chicago Manual of Style note and bibliography style above all, because
it’s the most flexible and most accessible when reading a piece. Citations and
explanatory notes are conveniently located for the reader: there’s no need to
flip back and forth to some list of notes who knows where to find your information.

If footnotes aren’t allowed, I prefer in-text citations and endnotes for
explanatory comments. This is consistent with what I like about CMS note and
bibliography style: it’s easy to tell what’s a citation and what’s a comment;
citations are conveniently located for the reader. Having to flip to a notes
page for explantory comments is much less annoying than it is for citations.
Explanatory comments are less common than citations, and so it’s not as disruptive
an intrusion.

Endnote-only has some merit (allowing you to explain citations, for example), but
is extremely inconvenient when reading. (Then again, it *does* make it very easy
to mine for specific sources.)
