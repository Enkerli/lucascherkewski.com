Chicago Manual of Style notes and bibliography style, with footnotes, is best—it’s the most flexible and most accessible when reading a piece. Citations and explanatory notes are conveniently located for the reader: there’s no need to flip back and forth to a hard-to-find list of endnotes.

If footnotes aren’t allowed, I prefer in-text citations and endnotes for explanatory comments. This aligns with the best of CMS notes and bibliography style: it’s easy to tell what’s a citation and what’s a comment, and citations are conveniently located for the reader. Flipping to a notes page for comments is less annoying than it is for citations. Comments are infrequent, so finding the relevant endnote is less disruptive.

Endnote-only has some merit (allowing you to explain citations, for example), but is extremely inconvenient when reading. (Then again, it *does* make it very easy to mine for specific sources.)
