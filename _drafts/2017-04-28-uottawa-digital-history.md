Studying for exams is exhausting. Before writing one, I find it useful to distract myself with some unrelated event. Previously, I’ve watched movies or bowled. This Wednesday I chose a different route: I visited uOttawa’s Digital History Open House.

Students expressed two mindsets about digital history. One views digital history as presentation; the other, as process. Most students viewed digital history as a combination of the two: a new way of presenting academic work supported by a new way of carrying out that research.

As presentation, digital history is a step forward. The keynote speaker, [Dr. Shawn Graham](https://electricarchaeology.ca), said he doesn’t want to mark any more essays. The students in the room agreed, and their work demonstrated it. One student explained how her game was a far more interesting product than an essay. Both to create and to experience, a game is a novel way to share academic research. But it isn’t mere novelty: digital history conveys information in different ways. Interacting with an exhibit instead of an essay, I process the argument—when there is an argument—differently, and walk away retaining more information. [fix that up, be more specific]
