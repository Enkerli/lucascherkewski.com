"But that's just good service."

Thatâ€™s how my tailor Raymond explained away his fussing over making sure
that I was satisifed. He went far above and beyond what I expected, finding
a way to save me money and still leave with what I wanted.

Thsi week has been a particularly good one for me in terms of customer
service. Learning from brick and mortar businesses is a great way to improve
online offerings.
