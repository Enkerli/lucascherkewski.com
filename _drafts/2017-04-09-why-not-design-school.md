Why aren’t you at design school? (Or studying computer science?)

It’s a question I often get once other people learn about my situation.

*What are you studying?* Political science and history.

*But don’t you design websites?* Yeah.

*So why the contradiction?*

For a long time, I’ve struggled to explain the apparent contradiction in
studying the humanities while working in design and tech. I’ve reached for
explanations posing the humanities as “studying my subject.” While not
wrong, they’ve felt insufficient.

Enter Michael Bierut.

Two essays of his answer the question more effectively than I ever have.

1. [Warning: May Contain Non-Design Content](http://designobserver.com/feature/warning-may-contain-non-design-content/4137)
2. [Why Designers Can’t Think](http://risd.generic.cx/why.html)

I came across them and nearly jumped for joy, they word my thoughts so well.
Maybe they’ll help others understand why I’m not at design school.
