*Why aren’t you at design school, or studying computer science?*

It’s a question I often get.

*What are you studying?* Political science and history.

*But don’t you design websites?* Yeah.

*So why not study that?*

I’ve struggled to explain why I study the humanities while I work in design and tech. I’ve reached for explanations posing the humanities as “studying my subject.” (A designer’s work is ultimately always about humans.) I’ve protested that you don’t need a design or computer science degree to work in those fields. While not wrong, such responses feel insufficient.

Enter Michael Bierut.

Two essays of his answer the question more effectively than I ever have:

1. [Warning: May Contain Non-Design Content](http://designobserver.com/feature/warning-may-contain-non-design-content/4137)
2. [Why Designers Can’t Think](http://risd.generic.cx/why.html)

I came across them and nearly jumped for joy, they word my thoughts so well.
Maybe they’ll help others understand why I’m not at design school.
