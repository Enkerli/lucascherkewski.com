Picture it: You’re working on a web design project. Things are humming along well, until suddenly you hit it. That moment.
*Here I am again*, you think, *that painful point in any project—designing the links.*

You may know this moment well. Certainly, I‘ve grappled with it quite a few times, and still do.

Browsers don’t help the issue much: the default link style is so garish, so brash, that we’re inclined to do something,
*anything*, to get it looking respectable.

This is the default link style: [Link to nowhere.](#){: #linkToNowhere} It’s quite harsh.

<script type="text/javascript">
	document.getElementById('linkToNowhere').href = '#' + Date.now();
</script>

Jarring though it is, the default browser style has two qualities that make it extremely clear that the content is a link: a bright blue colour,
high enough to create contrast against both the default white background and to stand out amongst the default black text;
and an underline, to help those with difficulty discerning colours. These two qualities *ensure* that the link will stand out
and be noticed.

Unfortunately, our occasional inclination is to style links almost to the point of invisibility. We do this by muting the
colours, bringing them much closer to that of the text, or by removing the underlines. There are any number of modifications
that we make when it comes to links. It’s probably just an extreme reaction to the scary default style, but it’s worth questioning.

See, links are the fundamental building block of the web. They’re *meaningful*. They carry weight. (With Google, literally
so.) We have links to thank for a huge part of the web’s success, and its power: with links, we construct the connections
that make the web’s potential for disseminating information so potent.

Links are so fundamental, Jeremy Keith delivered a whole keynote on them ([*&lt;A&gt;*](https://adactio.com/articles/10887){:link}).
In it, he speaks of the `<a>` tag’s history, and he uses the link as a model to explain how the Internet itself grew and changed to
reach where it is today. The whole piece is engaging—certainly worth a read—but this part in particular is highly relevant:

> The Garden of Forking Paths. It is uncontrolled. It is full of possibilities. It’s a bit scary. It takes more dedication to explore. You might get lost. But is that so bad? When was the last time you were truly lost on the World Wide Web, when you clicked through link after link—no cheating by opening new tabs, now—until you ended up somewhere, blinking and asking yourself “what I was looking for?”
> {: .measure}
> I would like us all to spend more time in the garden of forking paths. I would like us all to continue to grow this garden of forking paths. Add your own website to this garden of forking paths. Use it to make more links.

With links—big, bold, beautiful, obvious links—we shout our participation in this Garden of Forking Paths. We position
ourselves within the huge network that is the web, capitalizing on te relative instead of hierarchical organisation that
it fosters. We shouldn’t be ashamed of our links, styling them to near-invisibility. We should embrace them, styling
them to be obvious.

Links are the foundation of the web. Go make some.
