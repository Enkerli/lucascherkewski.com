Picture it: You’re working on a web design project. Things are humming along well, until suddenly you hit it. That moment.
*Here I am again*, you think, *that painful point in any project—designing the links.*

You may know this moment well. Certainly, I‘ve grappled with it quite a few times, and still do.

Browsers don’t help the issue much: the default link style is so garish, so brash, that we’re inclined to do something,
*anything*, to get it looking respectable.

This is the default link style: [Link to nowhere.](#){: #linkToNowhere} It’s not great.

<script type="text/javascript">
	document.getElementById('linkToNowhere').href = '#' + Date.now();
</script>

Unfortunately, though, our inclination sometimes is to style links almost to the point of invisibility. It’s probably
just an extreme reaction to the scary default style, but it’s worth questioning.

See, links are the fundamental building block of the web. They’re *meaningful*. They carry weight. (With Google, literally
so.) We have links to thank for a huge part of the web’s success, and its power: with links, we construct the connections
that make the web’s potential for disseminating information so potent.
