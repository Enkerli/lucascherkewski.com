Picture it: You’re working on a web design project. Things are humming along well, until suddenly you hit it. That moment.
*Here I am again*, you think, *that painful point in any project—designing the links.*

You may know this moment well. Certainly, I‘ve grappled with it quite a few times, and still do.

Browsers don’t help the issue much: the default link style is so garish, so brash, that we’re inclined to do something,
*anything*, to get it looking respectable.

This is the default link style: [Link to nowhere.](#){: #linkToNowhere} It’s not great.

<script type="text/javascript">
	document.getElementById('linkToNowhere').href = '#' + Date.now();
</script>

Unfortunately, though, our inclination sometimes is to style links almost to the point of invisibility. It’s probably
just an extreme reaction to the scary default style, but it’s worth questioning.

See, links are the fundamental building block of the web. They’re *meaningful*. They carry weight. (With Google, literally
so.) We have links to thank for a huge part of the web’s success, and its power: with links, we construct the connections
that make the web’s potential for disseminating information so potent.

Jeremy Keith puts this extremely well in his keynote-turned-essay *&lt;A&gt;*:

> The Garden of Forking Paths. It is uncontrolled. It is full of possibilities. It’s a bit scary. It takes more dedication to explore. You might get lost. But is that so bad? When was the last time you were truly lost on the World Wide Web, when you clicked through link after link—no cheating by opening new tabs, now—until you ended up somewhere, blinking and asking yourself “what I was looking for?”

> I would like us all to spend more time in the garden of forking paths. I would like us all to continue to grow this garden of forking paths. Add your own website to this garden of forking paths. Use it to make more links.
