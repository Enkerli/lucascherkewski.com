What’s a personal website? What are these things all about? Why should we even bother to have one, when so many services
exist to hold and display our content online?

I’ve struggled with this question for years: it’s resulted in bursts of energy towards new designs and new writing,
coupled with long, long periods of quiet.

<h2 class="f6 ttu tracked mt5 lh-title">Principles</h2>

Over a year ago, I sat down and wrote out a set of loose principles by which to craft a new personal site. Taken together,
they show my intention with this latest iteration.

* My personal site is a collection of things I curate—some of them mine, mostly not.
* I think through connections—between ideas, between people, between words—and my personal website is a set of connections.
* Thinking can take many forms. Writing is one of its best.
* Writing doesn’t have to be long; short and relevant works just as well.
* Curious exploration is one of the most rewarding experiences; my personal website is like a long, rambling walk through
  my brain.
* Our thoughts and beliefs change. A personal website is a place to document and celebrate this process.
* The web is loud, filled with noise, and huge. *Conscious, restrained cultivation is a real alternative to
  the web’s unchecked default.*

This last point is the most important, in my mind: though the web’s natural state is a beautiful thing, it too often
stops us from slowing to think. Other places for our content—Facebook, Twitter, Medium, and so on—offer convenient
interfaces and stores for our thoughts, but they pressure us to senselessly throw our thoughts into the stream. A
personal site provides a place for a slower, more considered pace.

Anne Lamott points out that there are essentially two metaphors to encompass human experience: the river and the garden.[^lamott]
All those other sites are rushing rivers, while a personal site is a growing garden.

A few years ago, my friend Isaac suggested that I one day publish a book titled “The Cherkewski View”. I don’t foresee
any books in my immediate future, but the title’s stuck with me—it may be slightly pretentious, but it’s also honest 
enough to suit what I’m trying to accomplish here. Thanks for the name, Isaac—you may have meant it as a joke, but it’s
one I took seriously. :)
