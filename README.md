This’ll eventually turn into my personal site. Hopefully.

Currently this site is straight `HTML`/`Sass`, processed with `gulp`. However, I’m working on a new site in a variety of repos:

* [The API repo](https://github.com/lchski/lucascherkewski.com-api), which will handle the database interactions for the site;
* [This repo’s `network` branch](https://github.com/lchski/lucascherkewski.com/tree/network), which has a (very rough) proof of concept for a new interface with which I’ll structure content—this represents the front end of the site;
* And, eventually, an admin repo, where I’ll build out the interface(s) for posting to the site.

Follow along, if you care!
