* on how constructed/commonly assumed images of public figures have major counterexamples/flaws
* Machiavelli
	* even though he's become an adjective, he himself was hardly Machiavellian as we understand it
	* what even is Machiavellian, today? what does it mean? do we employ it to describe situations where we're uncomfortable with the means used to achieve the ends?
	* he was actually an overly honest diplomat who never achieved for himself anything Machiavellian
	* [include photo of Machiavelli by CBS]
* *House of Cards*, *The Newsroom*
	* Newsroom especially, offers this classic progressive view of the news media as a shining beacon of hope and truth (whatever that means, of course); yet it fails to give women a significant role, relegating various would-be powerful women characters to little more than verbal punching bags for the men, with little agency
	* House of Cards is just overly gross, blegh
* Elon Musk
	* secretary story
	* racism
	* anti-labour (this isn't a surprise I guess)
	* I’m so skeptical of people who fetishize Musk’s success and tout him as the be-all-end-all on innovation (a word I also dislike, but whatever)
* Italian micro historians
	* they basically embody this notion
	* who are they?
	* Looked at grand overarching theories and approaches and questioned them
	* Didn't seek to simplify the world: sought to complicate it, to poke holes in theories that tried to explain it simply
	* Didn't worry too much about picking up the pieces afterwards; allowed the theories to fall and reveled in the complexity (the world is complex, and that's awesome!)
	* HIS2390 on complexity, role of history education, etc
* so what?
	* question question question!!
	* be critical, doubt things. it's fun ;)
