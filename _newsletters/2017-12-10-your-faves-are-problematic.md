Hello there! Happy Sunday to you, hopefully.

Sometimes we construct images of public figures that are flawed or quite contrary to reality. (Surprise, surprise.) Lately I’ve noticed quite a few examples of these; I want to share a few today.

1. Machiavelli wasn’t really Machiavellian. We use it to describe situations where someone acts cunningly, deceitfully, dishonestly to achieve their goals. Thing is, Machiavellian was an overly honest diplomat who never achieved for himself anything that could be described as Machiavellian. (This, from the introduction to Tim Parks’s excellent translation of *The Prince*.)
2. *The Newsroom* is pretty deeply flawed. When I first watched it, I fell quickly and completely for its classic progressive view of the news media as a hopefully shining beacon of truth. But then I realized that it tears down could-be powerful women characters and relegates them to pretty stereotypical positions.
3. Elon Musk is not what he’s made out to be. Sure, he’s built some very useful tech and invested in important space activities. But the way [racialized staff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-13/tesla-a-hotbed-for-racist-behavior-black-workers-claim-in-suit) and [women](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/the-tech-industrys-gender-discrimination-problem) are treated at Tesla is unacceptable. For a leader that ties himself so tightly to his companies (and thus must be held responsible for the behaviour and policy, formal or informal, at those companies), Musk should not be touted as the excellent role model as business or Silicon Valley people so often do.

Where does this leave us?

I’ve been studying for exams lately. (Writing this is a welcome reprieve.) One of my courses is on micro-history, a specific approach to historical research.

A group of Italian historians are largely to thank (or blame) for micro-history as we understand it today. Historians like Carlo Ginzburg and Giovanni Levi took great pride in questioning overarching, deterministic historical theories—theories that tried to explain history in simple, reductive ways. They didn't seek to simplify the world: they sought to complicate it. 

Their research focused on extremely small traces of the past—the diaries of an eccentric figure from a small village, for example—to break apart the simple visions of the past presented by generalizing theories. They didn’t worry too much about picking up the pieces afterwards: they allowed the theories to fall and then reveled in the resulting complexity, because the world is complex and *embracing it is kinda awesome*.

So what can these micro-historians teach us? The answer to questions like this is usually the same, but it’s worth repeating nonetheless: be critical by questioning relentlessly.
