It’s funny how one small conversation can tip off a series of larger changes in your life.

In talking with friends last weekend, I remembered the brief history of timekeeping that Nicholas Carr provides in *The Shallows*. As part of his larger exploration of the impact of the internet on our brains, he explains how progressively more advanced forms of timekeeping (from sundials to church bells to a watch on every wrist) shaped our experience of time and the organization of our lives.

When I got back home, I picked the book off my shelf, thinking I’d reread the section in question. As is often the case when rereading old favourites, I found myself flipping through whole chapters, retreading ground whose lessons I thought I’d taken to heart. Upon further reflection, though, I realized that I’d let the internet come crashing back into my life—something I’m now pushing back against.

See, I’ve long had a complicated relationship with the internet. On the one hand, it’s granted me countless opportunities: through it, I’ve learnt new skills and worked a part-time job, met friends and heard so many new perspectives. On the other, I’ve long felt—literally felt—as if my near-constant internet use was breaking up my focus and diluting my effectiveness. I thought it was reshaping me.

When I first read *The Shallows*, I found an author whose experience largely echoed my own. Carr contextualizes his experience with findings from historical, biological, and psychological studies: it seems that the internet *is* reshaping us, both physically and intellectually. Rereading chapters from the book, I heard anew his call to critically reevaluate the place of technology in our lives.

The morning after I revisited *The Shallows*, I read an article on [societal sleep deprivation](http://www.esquire.co.uk/life/fitness-wellbeing/longform/a18577/sleep-loss-epidemic-insomnia-treatment/). One line jumped out at me: describing the busy mix of modern life, Joanna Fuertes writes that "we have online lives to maintain." That notion, that we have online lives in addition to our physical ones, is one I used to carefully consider: in the last few years, though, I’ve let this attention to the connection between technology and everyday life fade away, accepting that life with the internet is natural and normal.

But it isn’t, really. Or at least it doesn’t have to be. Based on these thoughts, [I decided on Wednesday to take a break from some social media](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/no-more-accidental-noise/)—Twitter especially—for a while. I don’t know if it’ll address much in the long term, but the last few disconnected days have been noticeably more peaceful.

Maybe it’s just wishful thinking, but I do hope that this calm is linked to my disconnect. I feel better already. I hope that more time will deepen that feeling, but I’m also realistic—I expect I may eventually return to Twitter. It’s a tough thing to reconcile, but I’m working through it.

Have you experienced any of these sentiments? How do you deal with them? How do you carve out quiet space from all the noise? I’m curious, and would be happy to chat about it with you.

All the best for the week ahead.
