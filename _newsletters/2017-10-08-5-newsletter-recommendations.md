Good morning!

It’s a long weekend here. That means this newsletter is nice and short. Too much time off means too little time to write, apparently :)

I thought I’d share a list of newsletters I particularly enjoy. Each of them is written by a person, with no institution or “brand” at play. Reading them makes me happy. In a way, these all inspire my own newsletter—I aspire to be as worth reading as them. If any interest you, consider checking them out:

* [Mandy Brown](https://tinyletter.com/aworkinglibrary): Insightful commentary on systemic issues troubling society, book analyses, and cocktails. (If you subscribe to just one, I’d make it this one.)
* [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/): An interesting list every week, containing book recommendations and other advice for living a fuller life.
* [Melissa Gira Grant](http://melissagiragrant.com/letters/): Insight on sex work and human rights, including behind-the-scenes thoughts on writing and neat desk photos.
* [Jamelle Bouie](https://jamellebouie.net/the-newsletter/): Recipes, photos, and a collection of interesting articles to read every week.
* [Jack Cheng](https://jackcheng.com/sunday/): An intimate perspective on the writing process, always with interesting snapshots of life during the previous week.
* [Deb Chachra](https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry): Critical technology commentary from the academic perspective, among other neat tidbits.

That’s all for this week! Have a great one, folks. You’re all awesome :)
