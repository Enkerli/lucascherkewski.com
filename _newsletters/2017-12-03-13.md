It has been seven years. On October 30, 2010, I issued my first invoice for web development work. At the time, I doubt I realized how much itâ€™d shape the years to come.

* "the seven year itch" (but w/r/t your work)
* over seven years that I've been doing this (more than a third of my life)
* shaped my life:
	* WordCamps and the WordPress community
	* other conferences
	* relatively unique part-time job experience as a highschool student
	* exposed to realities of managing a business (both the upsides and the downsides)
		* learnt a lot about invoicing
		* learnt a lot about taxes
	* met so many great people!
	* led to involvement in other communities, e.g. YOWCT
	* lent me an interesting perspective on some school projects, including opening my interest to digital humanities
		* one of my earliest, albeit unconscious, attempts in this space had to do with creating a website for a science fair project instead of a board (I was sick of making boards and my science teacher was quite obliging)
* am I itching for a change? somewhat. I want to start taking my technical knowledge and experience in learning how to work on the web and applying it in new ways: in research (DH), in policy, in strategy
	* feels weird for me to say strategy... I dunno that I have the right perspective to do that well yet
	* but certainly my perspective/practitioner background can be applied in other ways, in a research or policy capacity
