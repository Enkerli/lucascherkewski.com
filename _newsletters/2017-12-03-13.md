* "the seven year itch" (but w/r/t your work)
* issued my first invoice for web development services October 30, 2010
* that makes it over seven years that I've been doing this
* am I itching for a change? somewhat. I want to start taking my technical
  knowledge and experience in learning how to work on the web and applying
  it in new ways: in research (DH), in policy, in strategy
